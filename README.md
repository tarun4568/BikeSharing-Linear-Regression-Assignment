## General Information
- A bike-sharing system is a service for giving bike on Rents from dock. Business wants to understand how the demand varies exactly with the various features. To understand it need to build a model
- BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.
- You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations.
- Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors.


## Conclusions
- Bike sharing rentals are more when wheather is more clearer
- On increasing the temperature the bike rentals significantly increase
- There is inverse impact of windspeed, if windpeed is more then bike rentals demand will be less
- In weathers situations like Rainy season, thunderstorm and snow, the bike demand decrease.
